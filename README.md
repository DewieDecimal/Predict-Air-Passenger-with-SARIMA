# Predict-Air-Passenger-with-SARIMA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on utilizing the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) package to predict the number of air passengers. The analysis is conducted on the "Air Passenger Data for Time Series Analysis" dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary aim is to develop a predictive model that effectively captures the underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality in air passenger data.

## Problem Statement
Air passenger traffic is a critical factor in the aviation industry, impacting various aspects such as flight scheduling, resource allocation, and revenue forecasting. Accurate prediction of air passenger numbers is essential for airlines, airports, and related stakeholders to make informed decisions. By developing a robust prediction model, we aim to address the challenge of anticipating future passenger demand, allowing for better planning and resource utilization.

## Why it Matters
Efficiently predicting air passenger numbers can yield several benefits, including:
1. Optimized Resource Allocation: Airlines and airports can adjust their operations, staffing, and logistics based on predicted passenger numbers, avoiding overstaffing or insufficient resources.
2. Enhanced Customer Experience: Accurate predictions enable airlines to provide better services, such as timely flights, adequate seating, and sufficient in-flight amenities.
3. Revenue Generation: Accurate forecasts can lead to improved revenue management by optimizing ticket pricing and promotional strategies.
4. Infrastructure Planning: Airports can plan expansions, renovations, and infrastructure improvements based on projected passenger growth.

## Key Steps



## Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:
* numpy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
* pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library.
* matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
